|-----|----------|--------|
|Video1|0|NA for HW|
|Video2|0|NA for HW|
|Workload is comparable for everyone except for two users whose added lines are 10 fold less than other teammates|2|[GitHub Insights](https://github.com/SASWAT123/SoftwareEngineering/graphs/contributors)|
|Number of commits|3|Total 84 commit history|
|Number of commits: by different people|2|[GitHub Insights](https://github.com/SASWAT123/SoftwareEngineering/graphs/contributors)|
|Issues reports: there is **No issues in repo**|0|only 2 issues created [Issues](https://github.com/SASWAT123/SoftwareEngineering/issues)|
|Issues are being closed|0|No issues created in the repo|
|DOI badge: exists|3|Exists in [README.md](https://github.com/SASWAT123/SoftwareEngineering/blob/master/README.md)|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |0|Can't find docs|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |0|Can't find docs|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|0|Can't find docs|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|1|No docs, Readme has basic information|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|0|NA for this hw|
