|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|2|[GitHub Insights](https://github.com/Lamonkey/csc510_hw/graphs/contributors)|
|Number of commits|3|Total 241 commit history|
|Number of commits: by different people|3|[GitHub Insights](https://github.com/Lamonkey/csc510_hw/graphs/contributors)|
|Issues reports: there are **many**|3|40 issues open|
|Issues are being closed|2|32 issues closed|
|DOI badge: exists|3|Exists in [README.md](https://github.com/Lamonkey/csc510_hw#readme)|
|Docs: documents generated, format not ugly |0|No documents generated|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |0|No documents generated|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|0|No documents generated|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|1|README needs more details [README.md](https://github.com/Lamonkey/csc510_hw#readme)|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|0|NA for this hw|
|Use of version control tools|3|Using GitHub for version control(https://github.com/Lamonkey/csc510_hw/releases)|
|Use of style checkers |1| code linting does not seem integrated|
|Use of code formatters. |1|Code Lintiting does not seem integrated|
|Use of syntax checkers. |1|Code Lintiting does not seem integrated|
|Use of code coverage |3|Code coverage is monitored through github actions|
|Other automated analysis tools|0|NA|
|Test cases exist|3|All the required test cases are present|
|Test cases are routinely executed|3|yes https://github.com/Lamonkey/csc510_hw/actions/workflows/python_unit_test.yml|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|3|Yes [contributing.md](https://github.com/Lamonkey/csc510_hw/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) is descriptive|
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|3| All the development is done by creating issues |
|Chat channel: exists|0|NA|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|3|Multiple issues handling failing cases|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|3|Everyone is committing and contributing throughout the code|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|0|NA for this HW|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|3|Since tests are running, it would be good|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|3|Well spread across contributions are noticed by commit history|
|Short release cycles |1|Just one release found 21 days ago|
