|-----|----------|--------|
|Video1|0|NA for HW|
|Video2|0|NA for HW|
|Workload is same for everyone except for one user whose added lines are 4 fold less than other teammates|2|[GitHub Insights](https://github.com/boscosylvester-john/se_hw_LuaToPython/graphs/contributors)|
|Number of commits|3|Total 99 commit history|
|Number of commits: by different people|2|[GitHub Insights](https://github.com/boscosylvester-john/se_hw_LuaToPython/graphs/contributors)|
|Issues reports: there is **only two**|1|only 2 issues created [Issues](https://github.com/boscosylvester-john/se_hw_LuaToPython/issues)|
|Issues are being closed|1|Only 2 issues were created and 1 issue is closed|
|DOI badge: exists|3|Exists in [README.md](https://github.com/boscosylvester-john/se_hw_LuaToPython)|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |0|Can't find docs|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |0|Can't find docs|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|0|Can't find docs|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|2|Readme.md does not have example|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|0|NA for this hw|
|Use of version control tools|3|Using GitHub for version control|
|Use of style checkers |1| Code linting does not seem integrated|
|Use of code formatters. |1|Code Lintiting does not seem integrated|
|Use of syntax checkers. |1|Code Lintiting does not seem integrated|
|Use of code coverage |2|SonarQube Analysis via GitHub actions but code-coverage not presented in README|
|Other automated analysis tools|0|NA|
|Test cases exist|3| test in test folder|
|Test cases are routinely executed|3| [yes](https://github.com/boscosylvester-john/se_hw_LuaToPython/actions ) |
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|3|Yes|
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|1|  Only 2 issues raised |
|Chat channel: exists|0|NA|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|0|Only 2 issues|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|3|Everyone is committing and contributing throughout the code|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|0|NA for this HW|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|3| Yes, tests are passing |
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|2|Yes contribution history is a evidence|
|Short release cycles |1| Yes but just one, which was done in the initial stages|
