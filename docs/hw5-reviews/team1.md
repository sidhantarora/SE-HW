|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|2|[GitHub Insights](https://github.com/sankettangade/aGoodRepoSE/graphs/contributors)|
|Number of commits|3|Total 96 commit history|
|Number of commits: by different people|2|[GitHub Insights](https://github.com/sankettangade/aGoodRepoSE/graphs/contributors)|
|Issues reports: there are **many**|0|2 issues open|
|Issues are being closed|1|2 issues open|
|DOI badge: exists|3|Exists in [README.md](https://github.com/sankettangade/aGoodRepoSE)|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |0|Can't find docs|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |0|Can't find docs|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|0|Can't find docs|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|2|Well written README.md|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|0|NA for this hw|
|Use of version control tools|3|Using GitHub for version control|
|Use of style checkers |1| code linting does not seem integrated|
|Use of code formatters. |1|Code Lintiting does not seem integrated|

|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|1|No issues|

|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|0|NA for this HW|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|3|Since tests are running, it would be good|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|2|Commit history is good|
